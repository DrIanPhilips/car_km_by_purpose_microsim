# car_km_by_purpose_microsim
An R repo estmiating car use for different purposes for English LSOAs

We investigated the potential for using a spatial microsimulation approach to generate small area estimates of car km travelled by purpose. We used two sources of data; a microsimulation based population projection (for the year 2017) and the English National Travel Survey anonymised individual records.  We constructed the estimates of car km travelled for individuals within English LSOAs using Monte-Carlo Sampling.  To understand the potential to develop this approach further we chose to retain small area estimates of total car km travelled and estimates of commute distance by purpose from the 2011 census for validation purposes.  The results are promising and show potential for further development.  The project was carried out principally using R, the code is stored in a repository to aid reproducibility and further development. 

A paper based on this work is being presented at the European Transport conference in September 2020
